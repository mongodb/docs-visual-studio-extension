Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the {+product+} rules and attached
messages. A rule evaluates different parts of your code and returns a
message if a specific condition is met.

For example, the Analyzer might apply a rule if it detects a LINQ
expression, which causes your IDE to display a message that contains the
equivalent Query API expression. Each rule has a severity level of
``Info`` or ``Warning`` that impacts where the message might be recorded.

Rule Descriptions
-----------------

The following sections describe each {+product+} rule, including the
rule category, severity level, and description of the corresponding
message. Each section also includes an example message.

MABuilders1001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``MABuilders1001`` rule evaluates your code for builders expressions
and triggers a message that contains the equivalent Query API
expression.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - **Category**
     - **Severity**
     - **Notes**

   * - ``MongoDB.Analyzer.Builders``
   * - ``Info``
   * - None

This code triggers the ``MABuilders1001`` rule to display a message that
shows the equivalent Query API expression:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   var filter = Builders<Book>.Filter.Eq(b => b.Genre, "Theory") & 
       Builders<Book>.Filter.Gte(b => b.Price, 10);
