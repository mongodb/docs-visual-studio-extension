Analyze Your Code

Overview
--------

Learn how to use **static analysis** to analyze your code with the {+product+}.
Static analysis is a technique where software inspects your
code without running it.

The {+product+} can analyze **builder** and **LINQ** expressions.

A builder is a class provided by the {+driver-long+} to help you construct
`BSON <https://bsonspec.org/>`__ objects.

Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is a query syntax included in the C# language. The {+driver-short+}
lets you write aggregation pipelines in LINQ.

To learn more about builders, see 
`Builders <{+driver-docs+}reference/driver/definitions/>`__ in the
{+driver-short+} documentation.

To learn more about LINQ, see the following resources:

- `LINQ <{+driver-docs+}reference/driver/crud/linq/>`__ in the {+driver-short+}
  documentation
- `LINQ <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/>`__
   in the Microsoft C# guide

To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see
:manual:`Aggregation </aggregation/>` in the MongoDB manual.
