Overview
--------

The `{+name+} <{+home-page+}>`__ is an add-on for the Visual Studio IDE
that uses **static analysis** to help you understand your {+driver-long+} 
code. Static analysis is a technique where software inspects your
code without running it.

The {+name+} can analyze the following groups of {+driver+} expressions:

- `Builders <{+csharp-docs+}reference/driver/definitions/>`__
- `LINQ <{+csharp-docs+}reference/driver/crud/linq/>`__
- `LINQ3 <{+csharp-docs+}reference/driver/crud/linq3/>`__

Use the {+name+} to answer the following questions about your code:

- How does your code translate into the {+query-api+}?
- Does your code include an unsupported LINQ or builder expression?

Read the following sections of this guide to learn how to install the
{+name+}, how to use its features, and how to configure it:
