Overview
--------

The `{+product+} <{+product-home-page+}>`__ is an add-on for the Visual Studio IDE
that helps you understand the following about your {+driver-long+} 
code:

- How your code translates into the {+query-api+}
- Does your code include an unsupported LINQ or builder expression

The {+product+} can analyze the following groups of {+driver-short+} expressions:

- `Builders <{+driver-docs+}reference/driver/definitions/>`__
- `LINQ <{+driver-docs+}reference/driver/crud/linq/>`__
- `LINQ3 <{+driver-docs+}reference/driver/crud/linq3/>`__
