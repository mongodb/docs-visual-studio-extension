Overview
--------

Learn how to configure the {+product+} in your .NET project and what
configuration options are available.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the {+product+}, perform the following actions:

#. Install the {+product+} as described in the :doc:`Install </install>` guide.

#. Create a file specifying your configuration for the {+product+} named
   ``{+product-settings-file-constant+}``.
   
   .. important:: Naming

      You can put your settings file in any directory, but you must name your
      file ``{+product-settings-file-constant+}``.

#. Add your configuration to your ``{product-settings-file-constant}`` file.

   The following sample configuration makes the {+product+} output your {+driver-long+}
   version in logs:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "OutputDriverVersion": false }

#. Add the following to the ``.csproj`` for your .NET application within the ``Project`` tag:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <ItemGroup>
        <AdditionalFiles Include="<Path to your {+product-settings-file-constant+} file>" />
      </ItemGroup>

To learn more about .NET project files, see 
`Understanding the Project File <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/deployment/web-deployment-in-the-enterprise/understanding-the-project-file>`__
from Microsoft.

To learn more about the ``AdditionalFiles`` tag, see 
:github:`Using Additonal Files </dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/analyzers/Using%20Additional%20Files.md>`
in the Roslyn documentation.

Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~

When the {+product+} analyzes your source code, the tool
sends the following information to MongoDB:

- Your .NET version installed in Visual Studio
- Your operating system
- TODO: Make sure this list is exhaustive

To disable this feature, TODO: Include how to disable.
