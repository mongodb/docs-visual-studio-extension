LINQ Expression Analysis on macOS
---------------------------------

If you are using the {+product+} in Visual Studio for macOS, you must
include the following ``using`` directive at the beginning of your
program to see analysis of LINQ expressions:

.. code-block:: csharp

   using MongoDB.Driver.Linq;

Error List Window on macOS
--------------------------

Visual Studio for macOS does not have the :guilabel:`Error List` window feature. If
you are using the {+product+} in Visual Studio for macOS, you will not
be able to see output from the {+product+}, such as {+query-api+}
translations, in one location.
